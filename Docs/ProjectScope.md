# Financial Management WebApp
A web application that provides a way to visualize your personal financial information, as well as keep the history of expenses and transitions. This includes you bank account and your credit card.

## Organize your finnancial life and meet your finnancial goals
We have so much financial information distributed in several different places that we can't visualize and don't even know where our money is going. A website where we can see all of them in just one place would help us to take control of our finances. We would be able to visualize, make our conclusions and take more racional decisions on our spending.

In the website the user can create an account and start putting his incomes and expenses records from both his bank accounts and credit cards. With enough information the user can start having a overall vision of his financial behaviour and generate reports on incomes and expenses. The user will also be able to categorize his transactions. When a credit card debit or a bill is due to date the system will alert you.
